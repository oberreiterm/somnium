### FAQ

#### What does Somnium mean?

Somnium is a latin word, which stands for a dream.

#### Do I need to use required/recommended plugins?

Plugins marked as required are needed for enabling all advertised features (f.e. Polylang for translating posts and multi language pages). On the other hand recommended plugins only enhance functionality and work well with Somnium.

#### I need more information about theme and documentation.

Documentation is available in English here: http://somnium.8u.cz/en/somnium-docs/

#### Some settings sometimes behave weirdly. What should I do?

Save your settings and refresh page. Everything should work afterwards.

#### Some setting is not saving at all. I have eliminated all other causes. What should I do?

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
